                <p> Much has been said about the history of this City. In fact, the history for the conceptualization of
                    Harbourvale City Rapid Transit spans back to 1982 (in Singapore retrospective)!

                <p> In 12 Aug 1965, after Harbourvale gained independence after Singapore gained it on 9 Aug. 
                The Goverment faced problems with road congestions. So in 1973 they Introduced Buses. but it can't solve in 1990s,
                So they decided to go on on a rail System.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Harbourvale Line 1987</h3>

                <p> HCRT was founded to Operate Harbourvale Line. The Harbourvale Line operated in the middle center side of Harbourvale City The 1st Phase of Harbourvale
                Line is between B3 Harbourvale Highway & H8 Bayshore, The 2nd Phase was between B4/W1 North Coast and B8 Blackton Junction, The Final Phase was from H7 Kegstone to H1 Harbourvale.
                H2 Was Wynyard and was closed as contracters of other building in the area was blocking off space to make way for the MRT Station until 1988 to finally start Construction Decorations,
                Wynyard was constructed with the other stations but some workers came in for development of the Wynyard area & the .

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">North West Line</h3>

                <p> North West Line was opened befor Stage 2 of Harbourvale Line. Which ran for a short 4 Stations W1 North Coast - W4 Lakeview
                    Commuters could see a block tunnel with tracks which was Stage 2 of the line E5 District to N7 Blacton South E as East from center of NWL.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Harbourvale Airport Express Line (now
                    Airport Express Line)</h3>

                <p> After a little debate of HCRT, they decided to construct Airport Express for a Branch of Harbourvale Line.
                    But in 1989 They Decided to cancel the branch and make it a single Line so it was named as Airport Express Line.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Kawasaki Heavy Industries C100A</h3>

                <p>For the Rail System they contracted Kawasaki and all of the Company of Kawasaki who was working on the Real KHI in 1985 and contracted Contract 100A.
                    All Motors was the same and the units delivered was the same as the real KHI C151

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Blackton Line</h3>

                <p> As the eastern and western parts of the city grew, the government announced the Blackton Line to be
                    built and operated by HCRT But Blackton Line was abandoned.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Evergreen Fields Line</h3>

                <p> Although HCRT was supposed to begin operations on this line by 2008, the line was abandoned due to
                    flaws in signalling and the land that the line was built on sank tremendously. HLRT (Harbourvale
                    Light Rail Transport) bidded for the new line and won the bid originally and renamed as Evergreen Fields LRT, but due to financial
                    problems (in reality, it's lack of time.), the line was given up to HCRT and HLRT was ceased.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Coastal Sands Line</h3>

                <p> As there was a "blank spot" between City Line and Airport Express Line, the Coastal Sands Line was
                    supposed to help passengers get from Coney Island (Yes, you heard it. It's called Coney Island) to
                    East Harbour quicker. HMRT was awarded the line's tender but ceased and given to HCRT and HMRT was ceased by HCRT.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Kegstone Line</h3>

                <p> There was not much a need to build this line, until Caroye began tremendous developement. HCRT was
                    awarded this line's tender. Construction has started. WTC is the official contractor of the line.
                    But The Line was no longer in use and got abandoned.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">City Line</h3>

                <p> Much like the Circle Line in Singapore, this line is basically... a circle. However, due to
                    underdevelopement in several areas of the coastal areas, this line was cancelled and abandoned.

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Second System Map Refresh</h3>

                <p> As the design of the old map began to look dated, a tender was put up to redesign the system map.
                    TDC (Transport Design Consultancy) eventually won the tender. This also marked the first time HCRT
                    did a reorganization of operators, and halted several lines due to rising costs. These include the
                    City Line, and the cancelled Western Harbourvale Extension.
                </p>

                <p> The LRT systems like the District LRT and Harbourvale City Light Rail (actually all LRT lines in
                    Harbourvale) were privatized, hence they
                    were not included in the official system map.

                <p>As HCRT was ceased by SMV SkyPeak Transportations re-founded HCRT as a remix company and the C651A/B/C/D was gone sent to Singapore for CLD,CDD & STARiS.
                    But the MRT did not went so well as SMRTO Contracted 9 Years for Exsisting HCRT Lines. The C651A-D in SMRTO's Fleet was scrapped but SkyPeak
                    Went to collect all the scrap materials and remaining trains from the C651A-D and the materials were sent back to Kawasaki & Alstom the
                    manufactures who made SMRTO's 2020-4 fleet. The HCRT was then called back to Bukit Batok, Singapore as SkyPeak is a HDB in Bukit Batok.
                    when the C651A-D were re-completed the HCRT was gone back to Harbourvale to do repairs in-house there. CDD STARiS VFD and CLD repaired
                    The Line was resumed where it came back from. In 2024 HCRT Contracted Kawasaki for C100A again for the Resumation of HCRT, 32 units was
